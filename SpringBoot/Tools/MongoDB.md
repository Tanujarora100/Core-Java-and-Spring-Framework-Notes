## Why No SQL?
    - difficult to store millions of data
    - horizontal scaling is much easier than sql database.
    - Good for Hiearichal Data
    - Unstructured data is much easier to store than sql database.
    - Sharding is much easier than sql database.
    - Queries can be slower if complex joins are used.
    - Easier for Good performance otherwise indexing is required for good performance.
    - Document databases in MONGODB and Stored in Key-Value Pairs like a HashMap.
    -Highly Responsive in Nature.

## What is BSON?
     - Improvisded version of JSON.
     - Support data types like date.
     - Parsing is much easier than JSON.

## Why RDBMS?
    - Large Structured data->Critical for data loss are much safer than no sql databases.
    - Complex SQL Queries are possible.
    - Data Redundancy is less than No SQL.

### How SQL DATABASE STOTRES DATA:
    - Each data is shred in objects into rows of data stored in multiple tables.
    - So We need to query multiple tables to fetch the data.
